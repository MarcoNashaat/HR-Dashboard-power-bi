# HR-Dashboard-power-bi
process of creating the dashboard:  
- importing data from excel file to power bi

- added four new columns used for insights in the dashboard:
  * WFH (1 for work from home, .5 for half day work from home, 0 otherwise)
  * month (the month of the record)
  * month num (the number of the month to help sort the month column)
  * day (the day of the record)
